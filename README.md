The YouTube Download Manager is a Python-based application that allows users to download YouTube videos or audio files directly to their local storage.
The application utilizes the PyTube library for handling YouTube links and the Tkinter library for providing a graphical user interface. 
Users can paste a YouTube video link into the application, select a download directory, and choose between downloading the video as an MP4 file or just the audio as an MP3 file.
The application verifies the validity of the YouTube link and ensures a directory is selected before proceeding with the download. 
Once a valid link and directory are confirmed, a new window opens showing the download progress with a progress bar and percentage indicator. 
Upon completion, the application displays the download status, video title, and file size. 
The YouTube Download Manager is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear instructions and feedback throughout the download process.
